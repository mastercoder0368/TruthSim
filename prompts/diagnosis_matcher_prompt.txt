[ROLE]
You are a medical terminology expert tasked with determining whether two diagnostic terms refer to the same clinical condition.

[TASK]
Compare the doctor's diagnosis with the ground truth diagnosis and determine if they are semantically equivalent.

[INPUT]
Doctor's Diagnosis: "{{doctor_diagnosis}}"
Ground Truth Diagnosis: "{{ground_truth_diagnosis}}"

[MATCHING CRITERIA]
Consider these as MATCHES (semantically equivalent):
- Exact matches (case-insensitive)
- Abbreviations vs full names (e.g., "URI" = "Upper Respiratory Infection")
- Common names vs medical terms (e.g., "Heart Attack" = "Myocardial Infarction")
- Minor spelling variations
- Synonymous medical terminology (e.g., "High Blood Pressure" = "Hypertension")
- Specific vs general when clearly the same condition (e.g., "Type 2 DM" = "Diabetes Mellitus Type 2")

Consider these as NON-MATCHES:
- Different conditions entirely
- Related but distinct conditions (e.g., "Angina" ≠ "Myocardial Infarction")
- Different subtypes that are clinically distinct

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Return a JSON object:
{
  "match": true | false,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these are or are not the same condition",
  "doctor_normalized": "Normalized form of doctor's diagnosis",
  "ground_truth_normalized": "Normalized form of ground truth"
}
